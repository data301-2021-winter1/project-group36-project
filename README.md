## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset looks at United States Government Medicare-Medicaid data from 2006-2012. The dataset itself contains demographic, enrollment, medical condition prevalence, service utilization, and state level spending as a way to provide transparency/accountability to American citizens.
We need to answer how this data was collected by looking at the MMLEADS PUF methodological file that is available.
