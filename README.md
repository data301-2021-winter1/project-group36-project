## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The American healthcare system is broad and complex, with many angles to look at. This can make it difficult to form a comprehensive understanding of the functions, and current state, of the overall healthcare system. While that may be, one can often find useful insight through analyzing specific (or related) components of the system. In this study, our focus will be centered around Medicare-Medicaid benefits/coverage, which accounts for a significant portion of the healthcare benefits receieved by the American public. Our goal is to obtain an accurate reflection of how, and where, these funds are allocated, in an effort to better understand its function in the general population. We will also look at data spanning several years, to establish whether or not there are any evident/notable trends in the data. Altogether, the scope/objective of our study can be summarized by the following:

1. Identify trends in cardiovascular disease, by race, gender

2. Identify trends in benefit type received, by race, gender

3. Establish dependence or independence between respective trends and geographical location, by region, state

4. Cross compare trends between demographics, by geographical location 

5. Establish if a relationship exists between identified trends

We will use these observations to answer, or explore, questions such as:

- Are there specific states that have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease or affliction over time?

- What percentage of disease occurs in marginalized groups?

- Has healthcare knowledge development impacted rates of cardiovascular disease?

- How has reprsentation, by race, gender, and poverty relation, changed over time (in relation to state level healthcare benefits and coverage)?

- Are the changes in representation related to the state? If so, are they consistent with changes in state population?

These are not the only questions we seek to answer, but they will hopefully suffice as a general framework for this study. All in all, this study will not provide a comprehensive breakdown of the American healthcare system in its entirety; be that as it may, our observations of state level healthcare benefits and coverage is intended to equip readers with a clear understanding of Medicare-Medicaid and its overall effectiveness/impact. Ideally, it will also reveal its shortcomings, and potential target areas for improvement. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset looks at United States Government Medicare-Medicaid data from 2006-2012. The dataset itself contains demographic, enrollment, medical condition prevalence, service utilization, and state level spending as a way to provide transparency/accountability to American citizens for people who are dually enrolled in both Medicare (i.e., over 65 years of age or have a disability) and Medicaid (i.e., have a low annual income). The primary data source was CMS's Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse which contains 100% of Medicare enrollment data along with claims for beneficiaries who are enrolled in the fee-for-service program. This data would be collected at the time of medical oversight then tranposed to this database on a weekly basis. Of this data, members that were dually enrolled in Medicare-Medicaid were utilized to give a comprehensive look at where federal and state resources are being allocated. (137 words)
