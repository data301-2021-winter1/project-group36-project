## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset looks at United States Government Medicare-Medicaid data from 2006-2012. The dataset itself contains demographic, enrollment, medical condition prevalence, service utilization, and state level spending as a way to provide transparency/accountability to American citizens for people who are dually enrolled in both Medicare (i.e., over 65 years of age or have a disability) and Medicaid (i.e., have a low annual income). The primary data source was CMS's Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse which contains 100% of Medicare enrollment data along with claims for beneficiaries who are enrolled in the fee-for-service program. This data would be collected at the time of medical oversight then tranposed to this database on a weekly basis. Of this data, members that were dually enrolled in Medicare-Medicaid were utilized to give a comprehensive look at where federal and state resources are being allocated. (137 words)
